## Overview

This repository contains 7 documents. Opening [index.html](https://billy-bartlett.github.io/plotlydeploy/) in your webrowser will take you to an interactive dashboard that displays data on belly buttons!

I was tasked with creating a Horizontal Bar Chart, a Bubble Chart, and a Gauge Chart to display belly button bacteria. I also customized the dashboard by adding an image, reorganizing the graphs, and adding a drop shadow to the text in the jumbotron. 

When a Test Subject ID Number is selected in the dropdown, information is displayed for that Test Subject. 

Enjoy!
